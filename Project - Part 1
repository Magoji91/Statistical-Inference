The project consists in the study of the comparison between the exponential distribution in R and the Central Limit Theorem.
The exponential distribution will be simulated in R with rexp (n, lambda):
* Lambda is the rate parameter.
* Average exponential distribution = 1 / lambda
* Standard deviation = 1 / lambda.
* Lambda = 0.2 for all simulations.

NOTE: The distribution of averages of 40 exponentials will be investigated by means of 1000 (one thousand) simulations in order to prove that the distribution is normal.

I-) SELECT TOOLS:
require(knitr)
## Loading required package: knitr
require(ggplot2)
## Loading required package: ggplot2
opts_chunk$set(echo=TRUE)
set.seed(1)

Initialize the variables to the values: 
n = 40 
lambda = 0.2 
number of iterations = numsim=1000

n<-40
lambda<-0.2
numsim<-1000

II-) CREATE THE DATASET AND EMPIRICAL MEAN: 

dataset<-matrix(rexp(n*numsim,lambda),numsim)
row_means <- apply(dataset,1,mean)
emp_mean <- mean(row_means)
emp_sd <- sd(row_means)
emp_var <- var(row_means)

III-) DISPLAY THE EMPIRICAL VALUES:
emp_mean
## [1] 4.990025
emp_sd
## [1] 0.7859435
emp_var
## [1] 0.6177072

IV-) THEORETICAL VALUE: 
TMean = 1/lambda
TStdDev = ((1/lambda) * (1/sqrt(n)))
TVar = TStdDev^2

V-) GRAPH
dfRowMeans<-data.frame(RowMeans) # convert to data.frame for ggplot
mp<-ggplot(dfRowMeans,aes(x=RowMeans))
mp<-mp+geom_histogram(binwidth = lambda,fill="white",color="black",aes(y = ..density..))
mp<-mp + labs(title="Density of 40 Numbers from Exponential Distribution", x="Mean of 40 Selections", y="Density")
mp<-mp + geom_vline(xintercept=ActualMean,size=1.0, color="black") # add a line for the actual mean
mp<-mp + stat_function(fun=dnorm,args=list(mean=ActualMean, sd=ActualSD),color = "purple", size = 1.0)
mp<-mp + geom_vline(xintercept=TheoryMean,size=1.0,color="orange",linetype = "longdash")
mp<-mp + stat_function(fun=dnorm,args=list(mean=TheoryMean, sd=TheorySD),color = "red", size = 1.0)


QUESTIONS
1. Show where the distribution is centered at and compare it to the theoretical center of the distribution.
The empirical distribution (4.9900252) is very close to the theoretical center (5)

2. Show how variable it is and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution.
There is almost no difference between an empirical variance (0.6177072) and a theoretical variance (0.625), as well as between the standard empirical standard (0.7859435) and theoretical theoretical variance (0.7905694).

3. Show that the distribution is approximately normal.
The graph shows a theoretical average as a orange line, while real media is shown by the black line. In addition, it shows a normal curve formed by the theoretical media and its standard deviation in red. Meanwhile, a curve formed by the real mean and the standard deviation are in purple. Finally, a real data density appears on the white bars.

We conclude that a calculated curve is very close to the theoretical normal curve, proving a Central Limit Theory.
